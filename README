# libxdrfile

Fork of GROMACS libxdrfile (based on version 1.1.4), with patches for uses
within the chemfiles project. This version is BSD licensed.

Changes from the original project:
* Fixes xdrfile [buffer overrun](https://mailman-1.sys.kth.se/pipermail/gromacs.org_gmx-developers/2014-September/007942.html) / segfault with malformed xtc files.
* Fix floating point exception in `xdrfile.c(decodeints)`

* Assume availability of C99 standard and headers (`stdint.h / stdbool.h`) and
  use them.

### Original README

This library allows to read GROMACS trr and xtc files and also to
convert from one format to another.

The library itself is offered under the BSD license, which means you are free
to incorporate it any way you want in other libraries or executables, no
matter what the final license is.
